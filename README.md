# website_Projects
germs for learning

This is all about getting more comfortable with website design and self promotion.  I will create a site, or 
suite of sites that will function as a resume for me, showcasing my educational and work histories and demonstrating
the various skills I seek to be paid for...full stack development of tools, web deployed applications, 
and responsive, dynamic websites.
